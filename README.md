# REACT REDUX COUNTER APP

Practice on the use of Redux without the use of tools or libraries such as Redux Toolkit or Redux Saga. In this practice, only Redux's own tools will be used.

## Project description

In this project we will build a simple counter that I think will help us understand the use of Redux without focusing much on the application itself and more on the tools that Redux offers us to create and manage our states.

On the other hand we can observe the folder structure that we could use to organize our code and components, in this sense this structure is based on projects that can have many components and states.

Our application itself, as I mentioned, will be very simple, it will allow us to increase, decrease and return our counter to its initial state.
